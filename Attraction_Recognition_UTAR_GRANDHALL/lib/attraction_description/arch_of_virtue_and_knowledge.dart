It also signifies UTARâ€™s wholesome education in technical competency and morality. Each arch, in its pure structural form, when viewed from below and above, visualises a pair of wings taking flight, symbolising success upon acquiring knowledge.'

Each arch is constructed from approximately 45 tonnes of mild steel tubes.
